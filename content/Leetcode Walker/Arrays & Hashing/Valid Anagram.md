## Problem

Contains Duplicate is an **easy** level problem, and is #242 on Leetcode. For the full description, see [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/). In Valid Anagram, you are given two strings `s` and `t`, where the goal is to return `True` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, and `False` otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another. Take, for example, the word `anagram` and the nonsensical `aaagnram`. Since they both use the same set of letters to form a 'word', they are considered an anagram (in our case, where we aren't worried about coherence).
