The Leetcode Walker Series are a set of tutorials in both video and text format founded by BaseScript's manager, Shadi El-Fares. See his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@shadielfares/featured) for videos of his own. Contributions to this series found on this website are developed by various developers at BaseScript.

## What is Leetcode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is an online platform that offers coding challenges to help users improve their programming skills and prepare for technical interviews. It is widely used by developers, students, and professionals to practice problem-solving, learn new algorithms, and gain hands-on experience with different programming languages.

LeetCode classifies problems into three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. Easy problems are suitable for beginners, focusing on basic concepts and simple tasks. Medium problems require more advanced problem-solving and understanding of algorithms and data structures. Hard problems involve complex logic and optimization challenges, often requiring a deep grasp of advanced techniques. These levels help users progressively build their skills from fundamental to sophisticated problem-solving.

## Format

This series will feature the use of different languages to solve problems. Leetcode can be solved using programming language, typically done using the programmer's language of choice. For this reason, there may be no consistent theme as to which language will be primarily used throughout this series.

The motivation behind the lessons vary for each developer, as this is a series meant to allow for our students to have freedom in the lessons they create. You may be lucky enough to find the Leetcode you were last struggling on... :)
