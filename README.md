## BaseScript 🪽

BaseScript is a project founded by engineering students at [McMaster University](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/)! We believe that the greatest way to learn _is_ to teach, and BaseScript serves as a bridge to fill that gap that many students struggle with — retaining what you know! 

This project focuses on becoming a widespread programming database developed by individuals who yearn to expand on their coding knowledge. Feel free to contribute to this project, whether you happen to be brushing up on an old language, or learning a new one altogether, let the world know what you have absorbed!
